This is the **CLI on my shelf (Tools and Hooks) for any my Python packages**
that help me to make Versioning, run Abbreviate of Git CLI, and Wrapped Dev Python
packages (`more-itertools`, `pre-commit`, ...) on my any Python package
repositories.

> [!NOTE]
> This project was created because I do not want to hard code set up all of them
> every time when I start create a new Python package :tired_face:. I provide some
> reusable CLIs that was implemented from [`Click`](https://github.com/pallets/click/).

## :round_pushpin: Installation

```shell

In the future, I will add more the CLI tools that able to dynamic with
many style of config such as I want to make changelog file with style B by my
custom message code.

  changelog: "CHANGELOG.md"
  mode: "normal"
```

`pyproject.toml`:

> The bump version mode able to be `normal` or `datetime` only.

### Override Commit Prefix

    - ["typos", "Documents", ":pencil2:"]  # ✏️
  commit_prefix_group:

```

## :dart: Mini-Roadmap

- I will implement use `rich` and `alive-progress` to this project for make
  interface terminal prettier.
- Dynamic emoji changing for support other platform such as GitLab.
- (BIG) Remove `bump2version` package and implement the own bump function.

> [!NOTE]
> I will migrate this code from **Python** to **Rust** for performance of CLI
> (But I will observe for this again because this package does not have any issue with perf as well.)

## :speech_balloon: Contribute

I do not think this project will go around the world because it has specific propose
and you can create by your coding without this project dependency for long term
solution. So, on this time, you can open [the GitHub issue on this project :raised_hands:](https://github.com/korawica/clishelf/issues)
for fix bug or request new feature if you want it.
